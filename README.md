## How to report a great bug

Please include the following when filing a bug to help us reproduce and fix it faster:

- **Title**: short summary of the problem
- **Steps to reproduce**: numbered, exact steps
- **Expected behavior** vs **actual behavior**
- **Environment**: TCAdmin version, OS, browser, database, etc.
- **Logs / error messages** (attach files or paste text)
- **Screenshots / recordings** (if helpful)
- **Frequency / impact**: how often it occurs and how it affects users

Example (short):

```
Title: Server list page crashes when filter applied
Steps: 1) Login as admin 2) Go to Servers > List 3) Apply filter 'status: inactive' 4) Click Refresh
Expected: Filtered list displays
Actual: Page shows 500 error with stacktrace
Environment: TCAdmin v3.2.1 on Windows Server 2019
Logs: attached
```

## How to request a feature

Prefer to discuss ideas first in `Discussions` so the community and team can provide feedback before a formal request:
https://github.com/TotalControlAdmin/TCAdmin-V3-Issues-and-Feedback/discussions

A useful feature request contains:

- **Problem / user need** — what are you trying to solve?
- **Proposed behavior** — brief description or example UI/workflow
- **Why it's valuable** — who benefits and how
- **Optional**: mockups, API ideas, backwards-compatibility notes

## What happens after you file an issue

1. We triage issues regularly and add labels (needs-info, bug, enhancement, roadmap, duplicate, wontfix, in-progress).
2. If more information is required we'll comment and request details — please respond to keep the issue moving.
3. Confirmed issues may be scheduled, linked to milestones, or added to the public roadmap.
4. Duplicate or unsupported issues will be closed with an explanation.

Typical response time: we aim to respond within 3–7 business days depending on volume.
